DESCRIPTION:
============

fTip provides a rich webbased admin- and userinterface.

The users can put their stakes on a game on this
webpage, and fTip compares them with the real results
later, and calculates userrankings.
Currently fTip supports the German Bundesliga, European
and Worldchampionship. Support for other leagues might
be added (relatively) easily later.

fTip supports many functions as:
 - independend user-sweepstake-groups, 
 - detailed statistics- and userrankingpages 
 - user-forum.
 - if user wants, fTip sends notification
   (stake-reminders) in case they have not put a stake,
   and later results per email.
 - detailed result-page
 - live league table (of the soccer-teams)
 - db-backup (for admin)
 - rss-feed with results of the games


At this time, we work on the bot BerND.
BerND: 
  -grabs the results of the running games from the
internet, and then updates the fTip database... so the
admin does not need to enter the results himself.
  - optionally posts live-results via jabber-chat to users




TO DO (philosophied over:)
==========================
- i18N support
- no need for global variables  
- more abstract meta-page "create new competition"
- several minor improvements




PLATTFORM: 
==========
(has been succesfully installed on:)
- FreeBSD 
- Linux
- Mac OSX

(might work on)
- Windows (untested)
